-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi John!

Thank you for scheduling your session with me. I am looking forward to our session on Tue, Feb 8, 2022, 8:00 PM CST.
If something comes up and the scheduled time will not work, let me know a minimum of 6 hours before the appointment time and we’ll figure something out.

This session will take place here: example.com

(If you have not used zoom before please join the meeting at least 15 minutes early because it may have you download and install some software.)

Again, all I need from you:
 *  Be on Tutors & Students Slack 5 minutes before your time slot.
 *  Make sure your computer/mic/internet connection are working.
 *  Make sure your workspace is quiet and free from interruptions.
 *  At the end of the session, I will provide you with a link to a 2 minute evaluation form that you are required to complete.


Slack or email me with any questions.  I’m looking forward to our meeting!
Please Reply All to this email so that I know you have seen it.

Sincerely,
Jack
